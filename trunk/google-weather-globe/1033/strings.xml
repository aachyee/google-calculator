<ABOUT_TEXT>Google Gadgets Weather Globe
Copyright 2007 Google Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Always updated, this Weather Globe displays the current weather conditions and 3 day forecast inside an attractive 3D glass globe. Simply enter your desired city and state (for United States) or choose from the list of cities in the options menu and watch the weather conditions change in real-time. Just like a real snow globe, mouse over the gadget to 'shake things up' a bit and make it snow.
