Bring some sunshine to your desktop.  This Virtual Flower Pot will grow to full bloom right before your eyes if you give the flowers some water using your mouse.  Just like any real plant, it will shrink if neglected.  It may take many days to reach full bloom, but it's sure to brighten your desktop upon every viewing.
